For assignment 1, read only one data file.  You MUST test with each file, as the columns have different order.

The data file must reside in this "data" folder.

You can declare that file name as a constant at the top of main.cpp (file that has the routine main(), or it can be in main().

main() routine must show the high level algorithm implementation. So the following must be crystal clear in main()
input  - where it is from
processing - high level processing steps
output - where output is going to go
